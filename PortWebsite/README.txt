# Automated Virtual Shopping System

This is a portfolio project built by Pravallika Mettukuru to demonstrate a virtual e-commerce system.
The **Automated Virtual Online Shopping System** simulates a basic online store, allowing users to:
- Browse available products
- View product images and descriptions
- Prepare for checkout in a real-world UI format

This project highlights my skills in front-end development and UI design using modern, responsive techniques.
